## Background/Motivation

The body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of $\frac{kg}{m^2}$, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.

## Formula for Calculation of the Body Mass Index (BMI)

This app helps to calculate a simple body mass index (BMI) using a simple formula :

$$ \LARGE BMI = \frac {mass_{kg}}{height_m^2} $$



This app calculates the BMI of individuals by entering the mass [kg] and the height [m].
